<h3>About</h3>

<p>Hello world. I&#39;m Lauren Wong. And this is my New York Times Spelling Bee Game Solver.
<br><br>If you found your way here, you&#39;re probably an addict of the daily puzzle published in the New York Times. 
So is my mom. Each morning, with coffee in one hand and the puzzle app in the other, she begins her 
daily quest for the holy grail... Queen Bee. Not that&#39;s not already QB at home. Anyway, you earn that rank 
when you&#39;ve found ever single word allowed by the puzzle maker, using combinations of the 7 letters given each day. The 
letters are arranged in a hive formation. The letter in the middle is the one that must be used in the words. 
Other rules: 4-letters or longer, ok to repeat letters and no proper nouns. My mom&#39;s quest often ended in frustration, 
which resulted in minor inconveniences for me, such as... additional chores, no homework help, etc. So I decided to 
help her out. Why not give her a tool with which she could find all the words and achieve QB, so she could sleep 
soundly instead of having to wait until the next morning to see the previous day&#39;s solution? 
<br><br>So I went to work building her a New York Times Spelling Bee solver. The solver pulls from several dictionaries
and combines them into one, while removing words that are known to not work. The dictionaries used are the English Open
Word List, the Enhanced North American Benchmark Lexicon, the Official SCRABBLE&reg; Players Dictionary, 
<a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words">Words Alpha</a> and 
<a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#3of6">3of6game</a>.
<br><br>My mom loved it so much, she shared her secret weapon with a good friend, who also now uses it daily.
After getting a lot of encouragement, I decided to &quot;go public.&quot; Hope you enjoy my version of
the NYT Spelling Bee Puzzle Solver. If not, take it up with the QB.</p>
